# Hangman-Game

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the child's game, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Its particular spin is its Day of the Dead themed-artwork, presented with a sense of humor about the author's current level of web page design skills.

## How to get started with the game
You can play the game online at [GitHub Pages](https://wucheeman.github.io/Hangman-Game/).

## Authors
This game was built and is maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and is not currently available.
