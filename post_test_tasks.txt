  (1) Didn't force user to continue playing; gave user a choice, with buttons. This is an added feature. The 'let's quit' button closed the window when the game was local which is nice. Unfortunately, now that it is hosted remotely, it must request the user to close the window instead. 
  (2) I use a button for the user to tell the game to start. This is an added feature.
  (3) I use key events to listen for user input of letters as required.
[x] Other comments:
   (x) HTML validates.
   (x) CSS validates.
