    r Press any key to get started! (Rejected)
    _ Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    _ If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

Hangman Game Bonuses
====================
[] Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
[] Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
[]**HARD MODE:** Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
   _ Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
   _ Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
   _ Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
